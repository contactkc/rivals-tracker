# Project Description
This project aims to develop a website that collects, processes, and visualizes player data from a video game. The system will leverage Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability. The program will support user authentication (if needed), data retrieval from APIs or databases, data processing, and interactive visual representation of player statistics. The goal is to provide an intuitive and insightful way to analyze player performance, trends, and achievements.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
